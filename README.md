# TOLC- The Online Learning Corporation

## Overview
So... COVID 19 happened. And here we are, trying to figure out if we are sending kids back to school in the fall or not. It’s stressful! 
TOLC is an online application that is simple and easy to use for children and tutors of all ages and backgrounds.
The application makes it easy to for Tutors and Students to connect with one another by setting up times to meet. 
The easy coordination ensures no tutor double booking!

## Main Components and Features

## Design
We wanted to keep our look clean and easy to use for students of all ages. We chose light and bright colors for kids, but still tried to stick with colors that weren’t too distracting.


## Future Improvements
* Chat App - Socket.io is a real-time chat application that works with the database to provide real time chat and store chat data.
* Calendar - Some people are more visual than others. It would be great to implement a calendar application that allows students to see what days and times their tutor session is.
* Profile Images - It would be a nice touch to know the faces of your tutor before you meet! Also a good way for kids to remember which tutor is helping with which subject.
* Progress/Status Bar - Another visual tool for students to be able to see their progress. 
* Payment/ Stripe Implementation - Tutoring isn't a free service and students will need to be able to pay on a subscription tier. Payment will need to be stored and updated within the application.
